# Notes
# Why to use create-react-app?
create-react-app is best for single page applications. It sets up our development environment with latest javascript features , optimizes your application for production and provides a nice developer experience.

# Javascript Callbacks
A callback is a function passed as argument to another function.<br>
Promises are ideal for multiple callbacks and used for asynchronous operations.<br>
A promise is either fulfilled or rejected.

# axios
axios is a promise based javascript library for making HTTP requests. Response is in JSON.<br>
Installing axios - npm install axios <br>
**axios.create ()** - creates an instance of axios which you can reuse for multiple requests. for example - set a common timeout for all requests.

# React Hooks
useState - track state in a functional component.<br>
**const [var , setVar ] = UseState([]);** <br>
setVar - function to update the state<br>
useState - holds the current state<br>
